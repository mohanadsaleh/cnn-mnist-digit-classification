## üìä Dataset

**Source:** [MNIST Handwritten Digit Database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)  
**Description:** The dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0‚Äì9), each of size 28x28 pixels.

- **Training samples:** 60,000  
- **Test samples:** 10,000  
- **Image size:** 28x28  
- **Classes:** 10 (digits from 0 to 9)

## üõ†Ô∏è Features & Workflow

1. Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset  
2. Normalize images and apply one-hot encoding to labels  
3. Build a deep CNN using Keras Sequential API  
4. Train the model with dropout regularization  
5. Visualize training history (accuracy and loss)  
6. Evaluate model using a confusion matrix
